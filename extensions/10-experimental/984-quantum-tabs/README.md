# Quantum Tabs (Extension 984)

## Description
An experimental extension that revolutionizes tab management with quantum-inspired concepts like superposition and entanglement, allowing tabs to exist in multiple states and be linked together for synchronized behavior.

## Features
- **Tab Superposition**: Tabs can exist in multiple "states" - switch between different page versions without reloading.
- **Entangled Tabs**: Link tabs together so actions in one automatically reflect in others (scroll sync, form filling).
- **Probability View**: See a probability cloud of which tabs you're likely to visit next based on your patterns.
- **Quantum Groups**: Create tab groups that collapse or expand based on context and time of day.
- **Timeline Navigator**: Travel through your tab history like navigating a branching timeline.

## Permissions
- `tabs`: Required to manage and manipulate browser tabs.
- `storage`: To save tab states and entanglement configurations.
- `history`: To analyze browsing patterns for probability predictions.
